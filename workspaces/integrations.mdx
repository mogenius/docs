You can enrich the capabilities of your workspace with integrations that connect your Kubernetes resources with data from external tools. This way, mogenius provides a streamlined interface for monitoring and troubleshooting Kubernetes applications.

## Github

Use the Github integration to add logs and status information from Github actions to your Kubernetes deployments. This will populate the **Build log** on your application's detail page as well as adding a **Build status**.

Here's how to set up the integration:

1. Go to the **Integrations** tab in your workspace settings.
2. Click **Connect** to authorize Github with your workspace.
3. On the following screens you can sign in with your Github account, set the Github organization and the integration's permission.
4. Once your integration is set up, go to the **General settings** of your workload. Set the repository that you want to connect with your application. If it has a Github actions workflow, the status and logs of your workflows are now available in the mogenius UI.

## Prometheus

mogenius natively integrates with Prometheus, allowing you to monitor custom application metrics directly within the mogenius platform.

How to set it up:
1. Make sure Prometheus is running on your clusterâ€”you can install it via a Helm chart, e.g., from the [Bitnami Helm repository](https://charts.bitnami.com/) (see [this guide](../deploying-applications/helm-charts) for help).  
2. Once Prometheus is running on your cluster, mogenius will detect it automatically.  
3. Open your deployment in mogenius, go to the **Metrics** tab, and click **Add Prometheus Metrics**.  
4. Select a PromQL query from the dropdown, enter a display name, and click **Create**.  
5. A chart will appear on your metrics page, visualizing the selected Prometheus data.

### Additional Info

- mogenius applies default [step values](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) for chart resolution based on your selected time range.  
- You can manually adjust the step value to control the resolution of the displayed data.

<Note>
All metric chart configurations are **persisted on your cluster**, meaning they are shared across all users within your workspace who access the same deployment.

## ArgoCD

With the ArgoCD integration you can monitor your GitOps workflow right within mogenius. Once enabled, several components will be added to your Workspaces:  
- Application status: Shows sync status and errors from Argo for a selected resource.
- Application overview: On the page **GitOps applications** get a list of applications, see included resources, and monitor the sync status.
- GitOps log: On resources managed by Argo you'll get a log with a history of commits and pull requests on the Argo application.

Check our [GitOps documentation](https://docs.mogenius.com/cluster-management/gitops) for more information and setup instructions.
