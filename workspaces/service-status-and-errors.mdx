Within your workspace there's several levels of monitoring that you can rely on. Data from the cluster is polled in real-time to ensure fast troubleshooting and a smooth experience.

## Status
The status module in a workspace provides a real-time view into cluster resources. If available, it will automatically show related status information from dependent resources. For example, a deployment can also show the status of ReplicaSets and Pods to provide you with all relevant information in one place. If a resource has recent events, they'll also be available by hovering on the status module.

## Metrics
mogenius collects metrics using its operator and the Kubernetes metrics server. By default, data for CPU, RAM, and traffic usage will be sent to the mogenius UI. The data is presented in charts on the workspace dashboard and on the detail page of an application.

## Logs
Logs are streamed in real-time from pods and jobs and made available in the UI on each detail page. There you can search and filter through logs. If a pod restarted, the previous log will be automatically inserted on top of the current log of a pod.

## Events
On the detail page of an application, events are collected from different resources related to this application into a single log.

## Integrations
You can extend the information on the application page with integrations that poll data from tools in your workflow, such as the CI pipeline. If an integration is enabled, you'll find additional status modules and logs on each detail page. Read more about [integrations](/workspaces/integrations).
