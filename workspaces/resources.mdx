On the **Resources** page, you can explore all active Kubernetes resources across your current workspace. The **Resource Manager** offers a powerful interface to help you quickly identify, monitor, and interact with these resources.

**Key capabilities include:**

- **Search and Filtering**: Narrow down resources using filters by resource kind (e.g., Pods, Deployments, Services, Secrets), status, namespace, or labels. This allows for efficient troubleshooting and resource management in large-scale environments.
- **Resource Actions**: Perform operational tasks such as restarting Pods, scaling Deployments, or deleting individual resources — all from the web UI, without requiring kubectl or terminal access.
- **YAML Access and Editing**: View live YAML manifests for each resource with syntax highlighting and the option to copy, inspect, or modify definitions. This supports advanced debugging and infrastructure as code practices.
- **Topology View**: Visualize dependencies and relationships between resources with the interactive **Topology Graph**. Understand how Deployments relate to Services, Ingress, ConfigMaps, and other components at a glance — especially useful for debugging microservices and validating Helm chart deployments.
- **Event Streams**: For supported resource types like Pods and Deployments, view real-time Kubernetes events and logs directly within the panel. This helps developers and SREs to investigate incidents without accessing the underlying cluster.
- **RBAC-Aware Access**: Actions and visibility are scoped by **Workspace RBAC**, ensuring developers, platform engineers, and operations teams only see and interact with resources they’re authorized to manage.
