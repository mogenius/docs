A workspace allows you to group a set of resources from Kubernetes based on namespaces, Helm releases, or labels. With integrated RBAC, monitoring, workload management, and pipeline integrations, workspaces provide self-service capabilities to any team.

## Adding a new workspace

Once a cluster is connected, you can add a new workspace. In your organization, navigate to **Workspaces** and add a new workspace. There's two steps you need to complete:

1. If you have a cluster with existing workloads, you can import these into a workspace. Select the namespaces, Helm releases, or labels, that you want to include in your workspace. They act as filters, so changes to resources inside these filters will be applied to your workspace automatically. You can also skip this step and start with a blank workspace. You can use the built-in tools to create namespaces, deploy Kubernetes manifests, or containers from a registry.
2. Add users, or select them from your organization. You can define their permissions based on pre-defined groups ([Read more about RBAC](/workspaces/members-and-roles)).

That's it, your workspace dashboard will be ready immediately. The members you invited will receive an email to join the workspace. You can now start monitoring resources on the cluster, troubleshoot issues, or use built-in [pipeline tools](/deploying-applications/overview) to create new deployments.

## Configuring workspaces and users as CRDs

Since workspaces are stored as Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) on your cluster, you can also define them via YAML manifests. This allows you to automate provisioning workspaces und users from pipelines, or during onboarding workflows of team members.

The following CRDs are used for this workflow with APIVersion `mogenius.com/v1alpha1`:
- Workspace
- User
- Grant

### Workspace

`Workspace` is defined like this.

```
apiVersion: mogenius.com/v1alpha1
kind: Workspace
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: '2025-03-27T21:06:24Z'
  generation: 2
  name: exampleworkspace
  namespace: mogenius
  resourceVersion: '4362774'
  uid: b400fefe-7678-4548-bd21-14c8e1781b73
spec:
  resources:
    - id: gitea # Identifies the namespace that should be added to the workspace
      type: namespace
    - id: discourse
      namespace: discourse
      type: helm # Add type: helm if you want to add resources only from a specific Helm release
status: {}
```

### User

Workspace users are managed on the cluster with the CRD `User`.

```
apiVersion: mogenius.com/v1alpha1
kind: User
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: '2025-02-10T08:42:11Z'
  generation: 1
  name: user-12d19670-2b9d-5320-ae2e-cb728fc4f70b
  namespace: mogenius
  resourceVersion: '1296441'
  uid: a30ea67d-d3a8-4be6-8c5d-b8ab45ef57cc
spec:
  email: email@example.com # An invitation email will be sent to the user to set up login credentials
  firstName: Linus
  lastName: Torvalds
status: {}
```

### Grant

With a `Grant` you assign users to workspaces and define their permission within the workspace.

```
apiVersion: mogenius.com/v1alpha1
kind: Grant
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: '2025-02-25T13:28:47Z'
  generation: 1
  name: grant-0e98deb9-5872-4e3d-8417-19031aa1950e
  namespace: mogenius
  resourceVersion: '2929550'
  uid: 223c3854-6b5f-4583-89c1-76b4278df4c0
spec:
  grantee: user-12d19670-2b9d-5320-ae2e-cb728fc4f70b # Retrieve this from the name of the User CRD
  role: viewer # Can be viewer, editor, or admin
  targetName: teamspace # The ID of the workspace where the user will be added
  targetType: workspace
status: {}
```
