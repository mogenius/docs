# Key Vault

Each project has it's own key vault where you can store and manage secrets with full encryption. There are two ways to work with your Key Vault:
1. Create environment variables when creating a service. They are automatically stored in your Key Vault.
2. Create a new secret in your Key Vault with the button "Add secret". You can set the `Key` manually or you can generate it using the magic wand.
