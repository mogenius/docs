# Key Vault

The Key Vault stores your environment variables with full encryption (read more about this [here](./../development/environment-variables-and-secrets.md)). There are two ways to fill your Key Vault:
1. Set environment variables when [creating a service](services.md). They are automatically stored in your Key Vault.
2. Create a new secret in your Key Vault with the button "Add secret". You can set the `Key` manually or you can generate it through the magic wand.
