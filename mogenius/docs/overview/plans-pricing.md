# Plans & Pricing

mogenius plans are simple and fixed SaaS subscriptions that consist of three major components:
- The number of clusters you are managing.
- The total number of projects in your organization.
- Additional services like SLAs or DevOps support.

:::info
mogenius does not interfere with your cloud account, so you are charged for resource costs separately by your cloud provider. An exception applies to managed clusters by mogenius, where cloud resources are included in your subscription. Read more about [managed clusters](./../cluster-management/managed-clusters.md).
:::

We offer three tiers of plans:  

- **Free forever** Use mogenius for free with one project on any Kubernetes, available for individual use only..

- **Team** Work in one project on any Kubernetes cluster together with your team.

- **Enterprise:** Connect multiple clusters and organize your teams with unlimited projects.
