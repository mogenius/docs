# Plans & Pricing

mogenius plans are simple and fixed SaaS subscriptions that consist of three major components:
- The number of clusters you are managing.
- The total number of projects in your organization.
- Additional services like SLAs or DevOps support.

:::info
mogenius does not interfere with your cloud account, so you are charged for resource costs separately by your cloud provider. An exception applies to managed clusters by mogenius, where cloud resources are included in your subscription. Read more about [managed clusters](./../cluster-management/managed-clusters.md).
:::

We offer four tiers of plans:  

- **Free forever** Use mogenius for free with local Kubernetes and for individual usage.

- **Team** Collaborate on local Kubernetes environments in a team and share projects.

- **Growth** Test, deploy and scale production-grade environments on any Kubernetes cluster.

- **Enterprise:** Optimize operations for high-demand applications in a multi-cloud environment.
