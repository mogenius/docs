**How to deploy ASP.NET Core MVC**  
To create your own ASP.NET Core application from scratch, you can add ASP.NET Core 6.0 MVC as a service to your cloudspace. Select it from the service library and follow the instructions. You will be asked to create a repository for this service where all the project files will be stored. Once the service is created, clone this repository and start working on your project. With every commit a new version of your service will be deployed automatically to mogenius.
