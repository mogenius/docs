**How to deploy**  
To start a Svelte project, you can deploy it as a service to your cloudspace. Select Svelte from the service library and follow the instructions.  
You'll be asked to create a new repository in the process. This will hold the boilerplate setup for Svelte and you can use it to start working on your application.
