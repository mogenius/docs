# Deploy a template

The service library contains a wide range of templates to deploy pre-configured services, like databases, frameworks, backend or monitoring tools, and many more. To deploy a service template, select your desired application type from the overview and click "Add Service."

When selecting templates you will encounter two types of forms:
- Template container images
- Template repositories

For container images you will see that an image and tag are preset.
