# Integrations

You can enrich the capabilities of your workspace with integrations that connect your Kubernetes resources with data from external tools. This way, mogenius provides a streamlined interface for monitoring and troubleshooting Kubernetes applications.

## Github 

Use the Github integration to add logs and status information from Github actions to your Kubernetes deployments. This will populate the **Build log** on your application's detail page as well as adding a **Build status**.

Here's how to set up the integration:
1. Go to the **Integrations** tab in your workspace settings.
2. Click **Connect** to authorize Github with your workspace.
3. On the following screens you can sign in with your Github account, set the Github organization and the integration's permission.
4. Once your integration is set up, go to the **General settings** of your workload. Set the repository that you want to connect with your application. If it has a Github actions workflow, the status and logs of your workflows are now available in the mogenius UI.
