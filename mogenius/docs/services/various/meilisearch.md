**How to deploy**  
To set up Meilisearch, you can add it as a service to your cloudspace. Select Meilisearch from the service library and follow the instructions. The service currently uses v0.27.0 of the [official Meilisearch Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/getmeili/meilisearch). If you want to use a different version, edit the Dockerfile in the repository that mogenius creates in your GitHub account when deploying Meilisearch. After changing the Dockerfile, run `Rebuild` from the service detail page to let the changes take effect.
