**How to deploy TiDB**

There is a detailed tutorial available on [how to launch TiDB with mogenius](./../../tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-tidb-database-in-the-cloud.md).


:::info
The database will be deployed in a container on a Kubernetes cluster, which is usually considered bad practice for production workloads. The service template is suitable for testing and development but we recommend to rely on a managed database service for production workloads. We'll support managed databases on mogenius soon - until then, we're happy to give recommendations for an appropriate solution.
