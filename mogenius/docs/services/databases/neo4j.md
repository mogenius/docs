**Description**

Build connected data applications with Neo4j in the cloud, a fully managed graph database.

A graph database stores nodes and relationships instead of tables, or documents. Data is stored just like you might sketch ideas on a whiteboard. Your data is stored without restricting it to a pre-defined model, allowing a very flexible way of thinking about and using it.

**Resource Requirements**
