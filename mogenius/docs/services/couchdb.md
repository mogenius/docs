**Description**


CouchDB is a database that completely embraces the web. Store your data with JSON documents. Access your documents with your web browser,  via HTTP.  Query,  combine, and  transform  your documents with  JavaScript. CouchDB works well with modern web and mobile apps. You can distribute your data, efficiently using CouchDB’s  incremental replication. CouchDB supports master-master setups with  automatic conflict  detection.

CouchDB comes with a suite of features, such as on-the-fly document transformation and real-time  change notifications, that make web development a breeze. It even comes with an easy to use web administration console, served directly out of CouchDB! We care a lot about  distributed scaling. CouchDB is highly available and partition tolerant, but is also  eventually consistent. And we care  _a lot_  about your data. CouchDB has a fault-tolerant storage engine that puts the safety of your data first.
