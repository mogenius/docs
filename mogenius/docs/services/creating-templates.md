# Creating templates

In the default service library you will find public templates that are available for every user. If you want to use custom templates that should only be visible inside your organization your service library can be customized. This way, you can publish templates for your teams to provide them with pre-configured container images or boilerplate applications.

Self-service for creating templates is currently in development. In the meantime our team will create internal templates for you based on your requirements. Reach out to them via support@mogenius.com.
