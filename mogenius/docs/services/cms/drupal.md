**How to deploy**  
To set up Drupal, you can add it as a service to your cloudspace. Select Drupal from the service library and follow the instructions. Drupal requires a database and we recommend you to launch [MySQL](mysql.md) as a service before setting up Drupal. This way, you can connect to the database directly at creation of the Drupal service.
