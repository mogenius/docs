**How to deploy**  
To start a new RabbitMQ application, you can deploy it as a service to your cloudspace. Select RabbitMQ from the service library and follow the instructions.  
You'll be asked to create a new repository in the process. This will hold the Dockerfile for RabbitMQ and you can use it to control the version your RabbitMQ service.
