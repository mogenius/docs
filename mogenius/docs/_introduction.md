## Welcome to mogenius docs

![intro image](https://imagedelivery.net/T7YEW5IAgZJ0dY4-LDTpyQ/93a77f3d-c1bc-4ac4-1c0d-739700d78400/public)
At mogenius, our mission is to make building and running applications in the cloud as easy as possible. We do our best to make mogenius a self-explanatory experience, but some things may need a reference. For that reason we created this documentation where we try to answer most of the questions around our service.

**Read our [quickstart guide](./getting-started/quickstart.md) to deploy your first service.**

## How to contribute

The mogenius documentation is open-source and based on Docusaurus. You can edit and create content within the documentation by sending a pull request with your suggested changes to [**Github**](https://github.com/mogenius/docs).
