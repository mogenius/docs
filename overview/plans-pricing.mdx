mogenius plans are simple and fixed subscriptions that consist of three major components:

- The number of clusters you are managing.
- The number of users in your organization.
- Support levels, SLAs, or any other additional services.

<Note>
  mogenius does not interfere with your cloud account, so you are charged for resource costs separately by your cloud provider. An exception applies to managed clusters by mogenius, where cloud resources are included in your subscription. Read more about [managed clusters](./../cluster-management/managed-clusters.md).
</Note>
