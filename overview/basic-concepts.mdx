The mogenius platform comprises multiple organizational levels tailored to various workflows and use cases for DevOps, developers, and teams.

## Organizations

Organizations are the highest level in the mogenius platform. Each organization has its own member list, billing, and settings. Clusters, workspaces, and other resources can be shared within an organization but not across different organizations. Organizations are useful for representing isolated groups of people. You can create multiple organizations to accommodate large, independent departments, subsidiaries, or clients who should not have access to each other's resources.

## Clusters

Clusters in mogenius serve as control planes for Kubernetes clusters. They provide various settings to manage the Helm installation of mogenius on Kubernetes, define policies and controls for workspaces, and monitor resources on the cluster.

## Workspaces

Workspaces are an extension to Kubernetes that allow you to group resources for a dedicated set of users, based on namespaces, Helm releases, or labels. Each workspace comes with a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring services and to navigate resources on the cluster in an abstracted and safe way for the team. You can create multiple workspaces to manage access and permissions granularly. Workspaces also come with built-in deployment tools, to either connect your existing build pipelines, or to create pipeline starters like Github Actions templates.

mogenius introduces a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for workspaces on Kubernetes. This allows you to create and update workspaces in your mogenius account as Kubernetes resources. This can be useful for automating the creation of workspaces, or for integrating it with third-party tooling.

Here's an example of a YAML that defines a workspace with two namespaces and a Helm release:

```
apiVersion: mogenius.com/v1alpha1
kind: Workspace
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: '2025-03-27T21:06:24Z'
  generation: 2
  name: exampleworkspace
  namespace: mogenius
  resourceVersion: '4362774'
  uid: b400fefe-7678-4548-bd21-14c8e1781b73
spec:
  resources:
    - id: gitea
      type: namespace
    - id: opensearch
      type: namespace
    - id: discourse
      namespace: discourse
      type: helm
status: {}
```
