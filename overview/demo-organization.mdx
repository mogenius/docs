If you want to explore the mogenius platform before connecting your own Kubernetes, you can use the demo organization. This organization is available to each user after signing up. It is connected to a Kubernetes cluster, has a public demo workspaces with several deployments and Helm charts, and allows you to navigate through all the features of the workspace.

## Demo workspace

You can browse through the demo workspace, discover logs, metrics, and settings, and get a feel for the developer experience with mogenius. This workspace is view-only, so you won’t have permissions to create, edit, or delete applications.

## 30-minute reset

The purpose of the demo organization is to provide an overview and a playground to explore mogenius. Therefore, the organization will reset every 30 minutes to a default state for security reasons. A timer in the header bar counts down to indicate when the next reset will happen.

## Working with your own clusters and workspaces

If you’d like to use mogenius beyond the demo, feel free to create a new organization and connect your own Kubernetes cluster using our free tier. Follow our [quickstart guide](./quickstart) for detailed instructions.
