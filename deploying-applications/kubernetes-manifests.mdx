You can deploy any Kubernetes manifest from within a workspace based on default resource templates. This way you can avoid creating local YAML files, applying them via kubectl, and instead use the mogenius interface to deploy manifests quickly.

To deploy a manifest, follow these simple steps:
1. Create a workspace.
2. Add an existing namespace to your workspace, or create a new one.
3. Select the kind of Kubernetes resource (deployment, pod, configmap, etc.).
4. Define the namespace where your resource should be created.
5. A YAML template will be shown. Configure the necessary values and then click **Create**.
