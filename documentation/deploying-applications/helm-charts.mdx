mogenius includes a Helm chart manager that simplifies managing Helm repositories and releases on your cluster. With this feature, you can monitor installed charts on your cluster and easily install new ones.

<Note>
  Helm charts are currently available on the **Clusters** page. Weâ€™re working on enabling Helm charts within projects.

## Accessing the Helm Charts UI

To use the Helm charts manager, go to the **Clusters** page within your organization. If you donâ€™t have a Kubernetes cluster connected yet, refer to our [quickstart guide](../overview/quickstart.md). Once inside the cluster, navigate to the **Helm Charts** tab.

This page displays:

- All installed Helm repositories on the cluster.
- A list of Helm releases, including their status, versions, namespace, and age.

By opening a release, you can view:

- Detailed information about the Kubernetes resources managed by the Helm chart.
- Configuration files, such as `values.yaml`, which define the chart's setup.

## Adding a Helm Repository

To add a new Helm repository, use the **Add Repository** button at the top of the page. Fill out the following fields in the menu that appears:

- **Name**: Internal name to display the chart.
- **Repository URL**: The URL of the Helm repository you want to install.
- **User Name and Password Credentials (optional)**: Provide credentials if the repository requires authentication.
- **Skip TLS**: Enable this option to skip TLS during authentication (optional).

Once the repository is installed, its charts will be available for installation. When adding a repository, the latest versions of its charts are automatically retrieved. If charts in a repository are updated later, use the **Update All** button to fetch the latest versions.

## Installing a Helm Chart

To install a new Helm chart, click the **Install Chart** button. Here's how to proceed:

1. **Select the Chart**: Choose the chart you want to install from the list or search for it by name.
2. **Configure the Release**: Fill out the following settings:
   - **Version**: Select the desired chart version from the list of available versions in the repository.
   - **Release Name**: Specify an internal name for the Helm release.
   - **Namespace**: Select the namespace where the chart will be installed. All resources from the chart will be deployed into this namespace.
     - We recommend creating a new namespace for your chart to prevent conflicts with other applications on the cluster. Use the **Create New Namespace** button to quickly create one.
   - **Chart Values Reference**: Review the default chart values. Most charts should install successfully with default values for testing purposes. You can refine the configuration later with custom values.
   - **User-Defined Values**: To modify default chart configurations or fill out template values, use the YAML editor. Copy sections from the chart values reference and overwrite them with your configurations. A custom `values.yaml` file will then be applied during chart installation.
3. **Confirm Settings**: Once your configurations are complete, confirm your settings to start the installation. You can monitor the installation process through the logs.

After installation, the release will appear in the list, and its status should change to `Deployed`. If errors occur, check the logs and adjust the release configuration as needed.
