If you want to explore the mogenius platform before connecting your own Kubernetes, you can use the demo organization. This organization is available to each user after signing up. It is connected to a Kubernetes cluster, has a public demo workspaces with example services, and allows you to experiment with your own applications.

## Demo workspace
You can browse through the demo workspace, discover logs, metrics, and settings, and get a feel for the developer experience with mogenius. This workspace is view-only, so you won’t have permissions to create, edit, or delete applications. If you’d like to explore deployments, you can create your own workspace within the demo organization.

## Creating your own workspace
The demo organization allows you to create one additional workspace. On the workspace overview, use the + icon in the top right corner to add a new workspace. Select the cluster from the dropdown and enter a name for your workspace. In this workspace, you can deploy services from git repositories, container registries, or YAML Manifests. Our guides in the section [deploying applications](../deploying-applications/index.md) will walk you through the different options.

## 30-minute reset
The purpose of the demo organization is to provide an overview and a playground to explore mogenius. Therefore, the organization will reset every 30 minutes to a default state. All workspaces and applications will be deleted. A timer in the header bar counts down to indicate when the next reset will happen.

If you’d like to use mogenius beyond the demo, feel free to create a new organization and connect your own Kubernetes cluster using our free tier. Follow our [quickstart guide](./quickstart.md) for detailed instructions.
