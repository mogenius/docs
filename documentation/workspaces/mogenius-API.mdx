The mogenius REST API allows you to manage your mogenius workspaces and resources in scripts, automations, and third party tools.

## Creating an API key
To authenticate with the mogenius API, first create an API key. You can do this on cluster level, or workspace level. Go to the section **API key** in the respective settings and add a new key by filling out the form:
- Set a name to identify the API key later.
- Define the expiration date.
- Set the scope based on the [pre-defined groups](./members-and-roles.md).

## Get started with the API
