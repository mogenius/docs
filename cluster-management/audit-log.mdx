The audit log provides a streamlined history of all changes made through the mogenius platform on your cluster. It serves as a crucial tool for identifying the root cause of failures and is an essential component for maintaining compliance in regulated environments through fully audited workflows.

## How Does It Work?
The audit log captures all changes performed via the mogenius platform. Whenever a user creates, updates, or deletes a resource on your cluster using mogenius, a corresponding entry is generated in the audit log.

## Logged Information
Each audit log entry includes the following details (when applicable):

- Type: The type of operation and resource, e.g., create/workload
- Age: Timestamp for when the action occurred
- Kind, Namespace, and Workspace: Details of the modified resource
- User: The mogenius user who triggered the action
- Diff: Shows a visual difference between the resource state before and after the change
- Status: Indicates the result of the operation (e.g., success or error)  

You can click on each log item to view the full API payload, along with the diff and any errors that occurred during the operation.

<Note>
The audit log only tracks actions performed through the mogenius platform. Changes made directly on the cluster (e.g., using kubectl) are not logged.
To ensure a fully auditable workflow, we recommend limiting direct access to your cluster and enabling user interactions exclusively through mogenius.
