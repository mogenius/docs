mogenius allows you to connect with Kubernetes clusters by installing the mogenius operator on a cluster. Once installed, you can start creating workspaces and manage Kubernetes workloads through the mogenius platform. To begin the installation process, you'll first need to add a cluster in mogenius.

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete the next steps, you will need the following:

- A Kubernetes cluster. We recommend a managed Kubernetes service, like EKS (Amazon AWS), AKS (Microsoft Azure) or GKE (Google Cloud Platform), but any cluster with Kubernetes version 1.24 or higher will work. To get started, a local Kubernetes like Docker Desktop, k3s, or minikube is also a great option.
- A working installation of `Helm` and `kubectl`
- OR optionally the [mogenius CLI](./workspaces/mogenius-CLI.md)
- Kubernetes cluster admin permissions

## Resource requirements

The mogenius operator is deployed to your Kubernetes cluster using Helm. It will require at least 0.5 vCPU and 128 MB RAM.

## Add a cluster in mogenius

In your organization open "Clusters" and select "Add cluster." Enter a display name for your cluster and confirm.

<Note>
  This will create a management pane for a Kubernetes cluster in mogenius. It will not create an actual Kubernetes cluster.
</Note>

## Install the operator

mogenius connects to your Kubernetes cluster via an operator that you'll need to deploy on Kubernetes. In the next step you will have two options to do this: using Helm, or the mogenius CLI.

### Helm install

Retrieve the Helm install command from the user interface and run it on a terminal. Make sure that your kubecontext is set to the right Kubernetes cluster. The command will look something like this.

```jsx title="mogenius operator Helm install"
helm repo add mogenius https://helm.mogenius.com/public
helm repo update mogenius
helm upgrade --install mogenius-operator mogenius/mogenius-k8s-manager -n mogenius --create-namespace --wait \
--set global.cluster_name="NAME" \
--set global.api_key="API_KEY"
```

### mogenius CLI

Install the mogenius CLI, on your terminal perform a `mocli login` and then run the following command.

```jsx" title="Installation via mogenius CLI"
mocli cluster connect
```

You'll be asked to confirm the organization, the cluster that you want to connect, and your current kubecontext before the operator is being deployed.

## Metrics server

Once the operator is installed, it will check if a [metrics server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) is present on the cluster. If not, it will be automatically installed.

**That's it - your cluster is connected and you can now create workspaces\!**

## Troubleshooting

If you're encountering issues with installing the operator, check out common problems in the section [Troubleshooting clusters](./troubleshooting-clusters.md).

## Helm chart values

The Helm chart for the mogenius operator supports a range of values that you can optionally adjust during the installation. Add them to the [Helm install command](https://docs.mogenius.com/documentation/cluster-management/installing-mogenius#helm-install) with `--set` .
